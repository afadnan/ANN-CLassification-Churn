# ANN-CLassification-Churn
ANN CLassification

The project ANN-Classification-Churn is focused on customer churn prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This means it aims to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with a business based on historical data.

This project contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify customer churn. The model is trained on a dataset (likely from a telecom or banking sector) where input features include customer demographics, account details, and usage patterns.
